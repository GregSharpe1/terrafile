# Terrafile

Terrafile is a binary written in Go to systematically manage external modules from Github for use in Terraform. See this [article](http://bensnape.com/2016/01/14/terraform-design-patterns-the-terrafile/) for more information on how it was introduced in a Ruby rake task.

This is currently an experimental WIP.
